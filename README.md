# SNBPlanning API

API for SBNPlanning tool, an engineer-to-work planner.

This repository contains both the API server, as well as the source code for the planning engine. 

To ensure that the data returned by the API still matches the specification, you shouldn't  edit the open_api.yaml file in openapi_server/openapi/ file manually, but instead edit endpoint.yaml, and regenerate the openapi_server using generate-openapi.sh
